## [Gist List](http://gist-list.herokuapp.com/)

A website that displays a list of all public gists from a given GitHub user. It uses Python2.7 and Flask.

## Setup & Usage
Clone this repository:
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/carolchau/gist-list.git
```

Optional, but highly recommended: Create an isolated Python environment to setup this project. I used `virtualenv`

Move to the project's root directory and install all dependencies:
```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:
```Shell
python app.py
```

You can access the application at `localhost:5000`.
